    "## Maximum Hydaulic Conductance in Aboveground Stem Compartments - FATES-Hydro\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we review and evaluate the functions that calculate maximum hydraulic conductance $K_{max(i)}$ of any stem compartment indexed $i$ in the plant.  The compartments can vary in depth and elevation over the height of a plant.  This is an evaluation of the formulation as per TFS and FATES-Hydro (Christoffersen et al. 2017), which uses concepts from Savage et al. 2010.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The process is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate maximum conductance from the top of the tree to both the bottom of the compartment $K^{-}_{max}$ , and the top of the compartment $K^{+}_{max}$.  Stem compartments are aligned in series, so the the conductance over the compartment follows resister theory:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ K_{max} = \\left( \\frac{1}{K^{-}_{max}} - \\frac{1}{K^{+}_{max}} \\right)^{-1} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The maximum conductance from the top of the plant to the  top and bottom of the compartments is derived from a maximum conductance that assumes no tapering effects of the xylems $\\tilde{K}_{max}$, and then modifies that result by a scaling function $\\chi$ to incorporate the tapering effects, based on work by Savage et al. 2010. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ K^{-}_{max} = \\tilde{K}^{-}_{max} \\cdot \\chi^{-} $$\n",
    "$$ K^{+}_{max} = \\tilde{K}^{+}_{max} \\cdot \\chi^{+} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The calculation of the untapered maximum conductances are straight forward, using a 1 dimensional flow geometry in Darcy flow framework, based on the material maximum conductivity of the xylems $k_{max}$, the mean cross section of flow (sapwood) $a_{sap}$ and the path length of flow. In FATES-Hydro, we use a simplifying assumption that the cross sectional area is uniform over the depth of the plant ($a^-_{sap} = a^+_{sap} = a_{sap}$), and that cross section area is based on allometry equations.  In each case, the path length is the distance between the height of the plant $H$ and the elevation at the top and bottom compartment boundaries $z$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\tilde{K}^{-}_{max} = k_{max} \\cdot a_{sap} \\cdot (H - z^{-}) $$\n",
    "$$ \\tilde{K}^{+}_{max} = k_{max} \\cdot a_{sap} \\cdot (H - z^{+}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The taper function $\\chi$, is by definition the ratio of the maximum conductances estimated using tapered and untapered assumptions, over a flow path from the top of the plant to the location of interest.  We assume that this proportionality is equivalent to a \"reference plant\" with tapered $\\tilde{K}_{ref,max}$ and un-tapered $K_{ref,max}$ maximum conductances, and over the same depth from the plant top to the location of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\chi^- = \\frac{\\tilde{K}^{-}_{ref,max}}{K^{-}_{ref,max}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\chi^+ = \\frac{\\tilde{K}^{+}_{ref,max}}{K^{+}_{ref,max}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The proportionality of the reference plant can be determined by evaluating the branching patterns and fractal nature of a reference plant (see Savage et al. 2010), or more specifically, as a function of the ratio $R_{x}$ of the xylem outer radii at the petiole to the location of interest (base of tree in their model):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ K_{ref,max} = a_p {R_x}^{b_p} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The level of taper dictates the slope and exponent parameters $a_p$ and $b_p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The radii ratio $R_x$ has been parameterized by Savage et al., based purely on the depth from top of plant $z$.  Which includes constants $n$, $L_p$ (petiol length).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ R_x = n^{N/2} $$\n",
